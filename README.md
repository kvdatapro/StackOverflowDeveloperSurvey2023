The enclosed dataset is the complete, cleaned results of the 2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. These are the files included in the Dataset:

2. `survey_results_schema.csv`: CSV file with survey schema, i.e., the questions that correspond to each column name.
3. `so_survey_2023.pdf`: PDF file of the survey instrument.


`cleaned_survey_results10.csv` is provided as an overview for the entire dataset after it is cleaned.

The survey was fielded from May 8, 2023, to May 19, 2023. The median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was 17 minutes.

**Respondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow.** The top 5 sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email lists, meta.stackoverflow posts, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the links for the survey and click to begin it.
